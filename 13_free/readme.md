# C Memory Deallocation: `free`

## Overview

In C, dynamic memory is allocated using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. However, it's the programmer's responsibility to release this memory once it is no longer needed. The `free` function is used for this purpose, to deallocate memory that was previously allocated by these memory allocation functions. This document provides a comprehensive guide on using the `free` function, its importance, and best practices.

## `free`

### Description

The `free` function releases the memory space pointed to by the pointer, which must have been returned by a previous call to `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`.

### Syntax

```c
void free(void* ptr);
```

### Parameters

- `ptr`: Pointer to the memory block to be freed.

### Return Value

- None.

### Example

```c
int* arr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
if (arr != NULL) {
    // Use the allocated memory.
    
    // Once done, free the allocated memory.
    free(arr);
}
```

In the example above, memory is allocated for 5 integers and then freed once it is no longer needed.

## Best Practices

- Always set the pointer to `NULL` after freeing it to avoid dangling pointer issues.
- Do not free the same memory block more than once. Double freeing can lead to undefined behavior.
- Ensure that the pointer passed to `free` was allocated by `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. Freeing memory not allocated by these functions can result in undefined behavior.
- Do not access memory after it has been freed.

## Technical Questions and Answers

1. **Q: What is a dangling pointer and how can it be avoided?**
   
   **A:** A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to memory that has been freed or is no longer valid. It can be avoided by setting the pointer to `NULL` after freeing it.

2. **Q: What happens if you call `free` on a pointer not allocated with `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`?**
   
   **A:** Freeing a pointer not allocated with `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` results in undefined behavior, which could include program crashes, data corruption, or erratic behavior.

3. **Q: Is it safe to call `free` on a `NULL` pointer?**
   
   **A:** Yes, calling `free` on a `NULL` pointer has no effect. It is completely safe.

4. **Q: What happens if you attempt to free the same memory block twice?**
   
   **A:** Freeing the same memory block twice, also known as double freeing, results in undefined behavior. It could corrupt the memory and cause the program to crash.

5. **Q: Why should you set a pointer to `NULL` after freeing it?**
   
   **A:** Setting a pointer to `NULL` after freeing it helps in preventing accidental usage of the dangling pointer. It ensures that any attempt to dereference the pointer after it has been freed will result in a clear and immediate error, rather than unpredictable behavior.
